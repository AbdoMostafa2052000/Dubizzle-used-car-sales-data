# Dubizzle Automobile Analysis and Prediction

This project contains two Jupyter notebooks: one for Analysis and the other for Prediction using various Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Dubizzle is the UAE's favorite marketplace to buy, sell, and find anything, especially automobiles.

## About the Project

### Notebooks
- **Analysis Notebook**: This notebook is dedicated to analyzing the dataset obtained from Dubizzle. It explores interesting facts and correlations between different car brands, resell values, and other relevant factors.
- **Prediction Notebook**: This notebook focuses on predicting car prices using various machine learning algorithms. It aims to provide insights into the factors that most influence car prices.

### Dataset
The dataset is primarily related to automobile sales on Dubizzle. It includes data points such as car brands, models, years, prices, and more. This dataset can be leveraged to uncover valuable insights about the automobile market in the UAE, including:
- Trends in car prices over the years.
- The resell value of specific car brands.
- Popular car models and their market performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the notebooks, you need to have the following installed:
